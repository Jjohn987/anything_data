      <description>Deep, labored breathing
Hello everyone, this is the opening post on my new blog, which I’m relocating from Wordpress to GitHub Pages and Netlify. It’s so nice I’ve given it a name - because nice things have names!

Note: This was my first “project” in R - and I had simple goals: learning data wrangling of a not-so-tidy dataset, and performing basic visualization. I wanted to learn the tidyverse set of packages, use pipe commands, and convert data from wide to long formats for different purposes.
I chose to learn the tidyverse because it gets all sorts of wrangling done about 90% of the time, (or so its said)</description>
