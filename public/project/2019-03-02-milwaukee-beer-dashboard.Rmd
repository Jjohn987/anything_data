Milwaukee Beer is a dashboard I built with R's `shinydashboard` package -- It  provides quick insights to into Milwaukee breweries and beer brewed in Milwaukee. You can toggle dropdown tabs to:

* get ratings for beers and breweries
* display results in reactive, dynamic, nice graphs
* track sentiment sourced from reviews posted on beeradvocate.org
* search for beers by flavor for convenient comparison
* and even dive in to the data yourself
* feel free to search for beer by type and flavor too! 

Of course, Shiny is also free, unlike Tableau or any other softwares that come with a subscription or membership of some type.
