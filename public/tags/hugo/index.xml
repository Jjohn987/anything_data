      <description>Deep, labored breathing
Hello everyone, this is the opening post on my new blog, which I&amp;rsquo;m relocating from Wordpress to GitHub Pages and Netlify. It&amp;rsquo;s so nice I&amp;rsquo;ve given it a name - because nice things have names!
But, why was I panting? The relocation effort wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Why did I follow through with it? Becuase it is worth the effort. This post is evidence of my victory. Now please, let me explain.</description>
