      <description>App: https://jjohn9000.shinyapps.io/Milwaukee_Beer_App/ 
Introduction: Milwaukee Beer is a dashboard I built with R’s shinydashboard package – It provides quick insights into Milwaukee breweries, and beer brewed in Milwaukee. You can toggle dropdown tabs to:
 get ratings for beers and breweries display results in reactive, dynamic, nice graphs track sentiment sourced from comments / product reviews posted on beeradvocate.org search for beers by flavor for convenient comparison and even dive in to the data yourself  Feel free to search for beer by type and flavor too!</description>

      <description>Milwaukee Beer - Inspired by my Job Hunt I’m excited to launch my latest Shiny app - “Milwaukee Beer” - which I made to learn shinydashboard. Due to my decision to return to the USA and hunt for a career in data, I decided to add another project to my portfolio.</description>
