      <description>In the last post, we saw frequencies of the most common words in the Analects, Zhuangzi, and Mozi texts. The faceted plot did an excellent job of capturing a generic “idea” of each text. However, I wondered how the results might change when plotting bigrams (2 word combinations of adjacent words) as opposed to single values.
This is where I ran into a problem with Tidytext – although it worked fine for tokenizing Chinese text into single character tokens, it did not perform as well at separating the text into bigrams.</description>
