      <description>I suddenly got bit by a bug to learn about network analysis. So I recalled the Correlates of War Project having a dataset about alliances. I decided to revisit them and download the data for this new project, which you can do to.
To start small, I decided to visualize a certain topic, e.g., European Defense Treaties relating to World War I. For that purpose I filtered the dataset for treaties that occured between 1878 and 1914.</description>

Network analysis and network visualization are two fascinating aspects of data science. Just about anything can be imagined as a network. The two basic requirements are:
 There should be a “distinct set of entities”, such as humans, organizations There should exist a known relationship between these entities (Zweig, 5).  Network analysis is useful when it can reveal much about structure, relationships, or arrangements.</description>

Note: This was my first “project” in R - and I had simple goals: learning data wrangling of a not-so-tidy dataset, and performing basic visualization. I wanted to learn the tidyverse set of packages, use pipe commands, and convert data from wide to long formats for different purposes.
I chose to learn the tidyverse because it gets all sorts of wrangling done about 90% of the time, (or so its said)</description>
