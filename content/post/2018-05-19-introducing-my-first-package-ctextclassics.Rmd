My latest update is a big one - a milestone!  I have authored my first ever R package, and it is available on my Github! It is an API caller for ctext.org, a site that hosts numerous pre-modern Chinese texts. The scope is broad, but think philosophical works in Confucianism, Daoism, Legalism, military doctrines, history compilations, works in medicine, and many more.

I've indexed at least 130 individual works and I'll keep an eye out for more.  The three main functions of ctextclassics are ```get_text("book", "chapter")``` ,```get_books("book")```, and the internal dataframe ```book_list``` which shows the available texts. So give ```unique(book_list$book)``` a try and download a classic Chinese book!


Now, it's not a perfect package. The API call method among various Chinese texts is inconsistent. Some book names are translated into English (e.g., "analects") whereas others are written in Pinyin (e.g., "mengzi") and some chapters cut out the word "the" whereas others don't. I may end up coding different methods into the current data frame. Or research other ways to match args. It's important that users be able to avoid inconsistencies inherent in the actual API. 



So, yeah. It isn't a perfect package.  But that's not the point. It is a start, and I love the feel of having my first package. 


My goal is to use ```ctextclassics``` for text analysis on Chinese classic texts -  Similar to how we see the amazing Tidytext and gutenbergr packages used. 


Sound interesting? You can use ```ctextclassics``` too!  Just type ```install_github("Jjohn987/ctextclassics")
