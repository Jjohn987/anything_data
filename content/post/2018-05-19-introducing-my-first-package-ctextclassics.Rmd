My latest update is a big one - a milestone!  I have authored my first ever R package, available on my Github! It is an API caller for ctext.org, a site that hosts numerous pre-modern Chinese texts. The scope is broad, but think philosophical works in Confucianism, Daoism, Legalism, military doctrines, history compilations, works in medicine, and many more.

I've indexed at least 130 individual works and I'll keep an eye out for more.  The three main functions of ctextclassics are ```get_text("book", "chapter")``` ,```get_books("book")```, and the internal dataframe ```book_list``` which shows the available texts. So perhaps try something like:
<br>

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(ctextclassics)
head(unique(book_list$book), n = 5)
knitr::kable(head(get_books("analects")))
``` 

<br>

It's not a perfect package. Like, be wary of the API limit. 
Currently the API translates some book names into English (e.g., "analects") whereas others are written in Pinyin (e.g., "mengzi"). Some books' chapters use the word "the" whereas others don't. So eventually I'll need to make the function calls more robust and help users avoid those inconsistencies. There's a lot that can be improved here, but I"m looking forward to it!


So, what's my ultimate goal? It is to use ```ctextclassics``` for text analysis on Chinese classic texts - Similar to how we see the **amazing Tidytext** and gutenbergr packages used! **Quite ambitious, I know.** At any rate, I'm enjoying reading this classical Chinese. 


To cap off this post, you can use my package by typing ```install_github("Jjohn987/ctextclassics")```.
